                    <p>Let's say you were making a division quiz to test on your students in C, who are working on division with decimals.
                    You decide to start relatively easy, with 5 / 2. Your code might look something like this. (Let's say you implemented <code>get_float
                    </code>or used a library).</p>
<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(void)
{
    float answer = get_float("Q1: 5 / 2  ");
    if (answer == 5 / 2)
    {
        printf("Correct!\n");
    }
    else
    {
        printf("Incorrect!\n");
    }
    return 0;
}</code></pre>
                    <p>Let's give this a test to see if it works so far.</p>
<pre><code>$ cc quiz.c -o quiz
$ ./quiz
Q1: 5 / 2  2.5
Incorrect!
$</code></pre>
                    <p>How could it be incorrect? Let's figure out why. Add a trusty <code>printf</code> statement of the answer:</p>
                    <code>printf("%f\n", answer);</code>
<pre><code>$ cc quiz.c -o quiz
$ ./quiz
Q1: 5 / 2  2.5
2.500000
Incorrect!
</code></pre>
                    <p>Well, it worked, so I guess the 5 / 2 is incorrect? Surely the computer can't mess up like that?
                    All right, let's find out:</p>
                    <code>printf("%f\n", 5 / 2);</code>
<pre><code>$ cc quiz.c -o quiz
quiz.c:8:20: warning: format specifies type 'double' but the argument has type 'int' [-Wformat]
    8 |     printf("%f\n", 5 / 2);
      |             ~~     ^~~~~
      |             %d
$</code></pre>
                    <p>That compiler just gave us a warning! It might look a little different depending on the C compiler you use,
                    but it says that 5 / 2 is an <code>int</code>! That is because of how C works with operations.
                    Whenever you perform an operation, if both are <code>int</code>s, then the result is an <code>int</code>.
                    If the expression's result is 2.5, but it is an <code>int</code>, it just straight up cuts that decimal part out.
                    Sure enough, if you type in 2 with our quiz program, it says "Correct!". So how can we fix this?</p>
                    <div>
                        <b>Method 1: Adding a decimal place</b>
                        <p>If you are just using constants, a decimal place might be a good strategy. To use this strategy,
                        simply add ".0" to the end. Instead of 5 / 2, write
                        <code>5.0 / 2</code>, and it works!</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <b>Method 2: Typecasting a variable to a float</b>
                        <p>If you are using a variable, you need a different strategy. It is not like you can just
                        do <code>var.0</code>! You could make that variable into a <code>float</code>, but if you are just using it for an <code>int</code>,
                        that might over-complicate things. Instead, use <i>typecasting</i>. This is where you add in parentheses
                        the type you want to change it to. For example,</p>
<pre><code>int a = 5;
if (answer == (float)a / 5)</code></pre>
                    </div>
